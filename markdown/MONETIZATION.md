# PDF Wonder Kit - Monetization Strategy

## Overview
PDF Wonder Kit now includes a complete SaaS monetization system with a $2/month or $20/year premium tier designed for impulse purchases.

## 💰 Pricing Strategy

### The "$2 Coffee Price"
- **Monthly**: $2/month
- **Yearly**: $20/year (saves $4 - 17% discount)

This price point is intentionally low to encourage impulse buying without much thought - it's cheaper than a coffee!

### Why This Works
1. **Low friction** - Most people won't think twice about $2
2. **Global appeal** - Affordable in any currency
3. **High conversion** - Easy decision for power users
4. **Viral potential** - Easy to recommend to friends
